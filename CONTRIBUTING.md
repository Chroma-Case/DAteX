# Contributing to DAteX

## CI Rules

The `main` branch is protected. Therefore, to contribute to DAteX, you will need to make a pull request.

On each merge on `main`, the generated documents will be pushed to the SVN. Therefore, you should always check them before merging. Every PR should be reviewed by at least 1 person (usually me, aha)

The CI checks for build, spelling and linting errors.
